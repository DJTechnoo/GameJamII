Plan: 

You're a zombie who's continously rotting, you need to feast on humans to survive. Humans consists of both harmless civilians who pose no threat and dangerous humans with weapons, IE Police/Military
Your zombie afflicition is not contagious.

The game will be divided into levels, with increasing difficulity, a level ends when you've eaten all the civilians. 
As each level ends you get upgrade points to upgrade your zombie, the points granted by this is based on how many hostile humans you've eaten.

One gains points by surviving, with bonus points for how fast you've cleared the level, how many hostile humans you've eaten and how fast you cleared it.

Defeat condition is having one's HP reduced to 0, it reduces both over time and as one is shot. 
You beat the game by defeating all levels while maintaining HP above 0.
